# PCB Design for a Noise-Shaping SAR

This has several goals:
1) Understand, design, and build a mixed-signal PCB using SMD components
1) Go through the process of FPGA design and synthesis, including asynchronous RTL design
1) Become better at reading datasheets for discrete components
1) Build a UVM testbench that includes real-number modeling.
1) Using IEEE SystemRDL to describe a register model.
1) Design an analog/mixed-signal circuit using LTSpice, instead of my usual Spectre.
1) Implement a system that includes some kind of bus communication protocol, likely i2c or SPI.
